  Hello there.


  My name's Mateus and I'm a researcher in Machine Learning applied for Wireless Communications. My current research involves ML solutions for semantic and goal-oriented communications.

  My PhD research was focused on multi-agent reinforcement learning for protocol emergence, by jointly learning a resource management policy and the associated signalling.
  
  My Masters research was focused in reinforcement learning based solutions applied in 5G scenarios.

  Aside from machine learning, I also have knowledge in Business Intelligence and Data Analysis from a graduate studies course.

  My main interests are Deep Reinforcement Learning, Semmantic and Goal-oriented communications, Link Adaptation techniques and PHY/MAC layers.
