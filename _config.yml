  Hello there.


  My name's Mateus and I'm a PhD. student in Telecommunications Engineering, my research is focused in machine learning applied to Mobile Networks, more specifically deep reinforcement learning based solutions.

  My Masters research was focused in reinforcement learning based solutions applied in 5G scenarios.

  Aside from machine learning, I also have knowledge in Business Intelligence and Data Analysis from a graduate studies course.

  My main interests are Deep Reinforcement Learning, Link Adaptation techniques and PHY/MAC layers.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Matlab</mark>
