    We propose a new framework, exploiting the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, to enable a base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) to come up with a medium access control (MAC) protocol in a multiple access scenario

    Accepted for the 2021 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps).
